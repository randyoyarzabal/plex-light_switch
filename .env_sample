# Due to a limitation with Plex webhooks, pre-rolls are required to detect movie playback when trailers are enabled.
# If you don't have pre-rolls, and yet you have trailers enabled, you may see erratic lighting behavior.
# Set this to 'Advanced' if trailers and/or pre-roll videos are enabled.
# Or set to 'Basic' if Plex doesn't have trailers enabled.

# For debugging purposes only.
DEBUG_MODE='False'

# Operation time range. Only run light triggers in between these times. This is useful if you only want to run at
# a specific time range. Use 24hr format HH:MM. Define as 'any' to run any time of day.
# Example: RUN_TIME_START='17:00' (5pm), RUN_TIME_END='09:00' (9am)
RUN_TIME_START='17:00'

# You may have to tweak these values for what works for you. This has to do with network
# delays/buffering so your values may be different.  The default is stop=2, play=3. But depending on how
# long trailers buffer you may even want to set these higher, like 5 and 8.

# Optional delay (seconds) after 90% ('End Activity'). Credits are usually far at 90%, you can add a delay here.
# Note that this delay will only be imposed on content where the 90% leaves enough time for this delay.
# For example, if you want to delay dimming of the lights at the ending by 2 minutes, set to 120. 0 = no delay.
